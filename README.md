A research article detailing Vespucci has been published in the 
[*Journal of Open Research Software*](http://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/jors.91/ "DOI:10.5334")

This branch is the active branch of the project and, while more stable than the branches of individual contributors, is **probably not stable**.

After the release of the first 1.0.0 beta, there will be tags established for releases.

Bug reports should be directed to the Issues tab.

Binary Releases:
-----------------
Releases for all three supported platforms are availible in the Releases tab.
The latest binaries are available at 
[Bintray](https://bintray.com/vespucciproject/Vespucci_automated_builds/Vespucci_latest)
The release package includes the executable, the Vespucci library and runtime pre-requisites
and the header files needed to use the library.
Versioning:
-----------
Versions up to 1.0.0 are not considered stable and changes between 0.n.0 and 0.n+1.0 may be major.
After 1.0.0, 1.n+1.0 will contain new features to 1.n.0, but will have an API that is mostly compatible. n+1.0.0 contains major changes in the API that may break programs built from it. 1.n.x+1 contains a bug fix or minor improvement to 1.n.x

Compiling Vespucci:
-------------------
Compiling Vespucci from source is not the easiest but still possible. Look at 
.travis.yml for linux and mac builds and appveyor.yml for windows builds.

Vespucci has the following prerequisites:
* Qt 5.5+
* Armadillo (with BLAS/LAPACK and HDF5)
* mlpack
* yaml-cpp

Look at the scripts used by .travis.yml and appveyor.yml to figure out how to
build on your platform.
